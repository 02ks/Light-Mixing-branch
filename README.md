# LightMixing
Six steppers (three gimbles), three LEDs, six peripherals;

Current State: All compenents work seperately and together in __main__.py. Other than maybe some additions to the GUI
or something, the code is working fine(currently with the original Joysticks, although there's a seperate branch
that uses the other type). Added features include centering, setting to white, a function that runs when idle, a different
speeds depending on how much one pushes on the joysticks.
Next tasks:
* Possibly switch over to new joysticks, would require facing the issue that only has occured with them where
the joystick gets confused about directions and allows the motors to hit the edges.
* Make electrical a lot better, as currently it's really messy

**This is the most updated and complete version of light mixing, I originally just made a copy of the engineering
repository that eventually became this place. The stuff here will probably eventually be transfered back
to the original repository**
