# LightMixing
Six steppers (three gimbles), three LEDs, six peripherals;

Current State: Many components work independently of eachother, but when we try to combine them (a la main.py) they don't work. The motors are working pretty well, but the lights flicker way too much. There are also issues with adding motors 4, 5 and 6 in the code

Next tasks:
* Get LEDs working properly. Some ideas: decrease sampling rate on knobs, test leds independently of motors
