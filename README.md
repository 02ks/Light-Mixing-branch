# LightMixing
**Note: This ReadMe was updated toward the end of the year. It is mostly a update to help those who will work on this project after us. Much of our code can look very complicated, but at the core they simply are of two things: a function, or code to make sure that function runs without issue**

Installation:

Light Mixing requires:
  - kivy
  - python
  - Pidev (Can be found on the DPEA github; typically part of the setup for kivy; ask Mr. Harlow for clarification)
  - Light Mixing (at least hardware to run code on)

Trouble Shooting:

- Firstly, make sure you are not editing the main repository. That code should remain unchanged until new working version. Instead, edit Light Mixing Branch, a respository that can be found through Alex's github (IncrediblyOriginalUsername)
- If you are having problems with our code (i.e. it's not working correctly when run on Light Mixing), feel free to double check with the code on the official Light Mixing repository on github. Some of our code on Light Mixing branch is still in development (Especially code like that of the color picker) and it is 


**This is the most updated and complete version of light mixing, I originally just made a copy of the engineering
repository that eventually became this place. The stuff here will probably eventually be transfered back
to the original repository**
